     <h2>Rules</h2>
     <p>1.Please make sure your garage door is open on pickup day so we can access your bin. If itâ€™s closed, we wonâ€™t be able to complete the service. </p>
     <p>2. If your bin is behind a gate, kindly leave it unlocked or provide a code so we can get through. Locked or tricky gates might mean we have to skip the pickup.</p>
     <p>3.For everyoneâ€™s safety, please keep dogs and other pets secured during service. If pets are outside or not contained, weâ€™ll need to skip the service.</p>
     <p>4. Please avoid any mess, be sure your binâ€™s lid is closed with no more than 12 inches open. Overloaded bins may be skipped for pickup.</p>
