        <p>
          Hey! I’m a 15-year-old from right here in St. Louis, and I started Bin Butler to make trash day easier for my neighbors. 
          I built this website myself because I’ve always loved creating things and helping people out. I know how busy life can get, 
          and sometimes taking the bins out is the last thing you want to think about. That’s where I come in — every week, I make sure 
          your trash, recycling, and yard waste bins are at the curb on time and brought back once they’re emptied. Bin Butler is a small, 
          local service run with care, built to save you time and make life just a little bit easier.

  <section id="Rules">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>1. Please make sure your garage door is open on pickup day if your bin is kept in the garage so we can access it. If it’s closed, we won’t be able to complete the service.</p>
      <p>2. If your bin is behind a gate, kindly leave it unlocked or provide a code so we can get through. Locked or tricky gates might mean we have to skip the pickup.</p>
      <p>3. For everyone’s safety, please keep dogs and other pets secured during service. If pets are outside or not contained, we’ll need to skip the service.</p>
      <p>4. Keep your bin’s lid closed with no more than 12 inches open. Overloaded bins may be skipped for pickup.</p>
      <p>5. Keep the area clear of obstacles.</p>
      <p>6. We do not carry heavy items—only normal residential bins.</p>
