     <h2>Rules</h2>
     <p>1.Please make sure your garage door is open on pickup day if your bin is kept in the garage, so we can access it. If it’s closed, we won’t be able to complete the service that day.</p>
     <p>2. If your bin is behind a gate, kindly leave it unlocked or provide a code so we can get through. Locked or tricky gates might mean we have to skip the pickup.</p>
     <p>3.For everyone’s safety, please keep dogs and other pets secured during service. If pets are outside or not contained, we’ll need to skip the service.</p>
     <p>4.Please keep your bin’s lid closed with no more than 12 inches open. Overloaded bins may be skipped for pickup.</p>
     <p>5.If your bin is hard to reach due to obstacles like cars, furniture, yard equipment, etc., we may not be able to move it that day. Please keep the area clear to ensure smooth service.</p>
